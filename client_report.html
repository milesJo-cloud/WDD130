    <h1>Client Report</h1>

    <h2>Client Overview</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to images and content that it boiled down to finding something that describe about me and ensuring the reflection was the same
        as well, to not go away from the main project itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Communicatiom</h2>
    <p>
        I would say the main communication came down to talking to them in-person but also emailing them if there was any issues from it. The only difficult thing
        was mostly hoping that the people were there and they did wonder.
    </p>

    <h2>Devs</h2>
    <p>
        I would say they did and to the point of I think there was a bit hesistant in one of them who was afraid of trying something out of his comfort zone which is 
        understandable but as well a lack of confidence in him.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to hiring a bunch of devs, it comes to finding the right ones who aren't afraid of trying something new but even challenging where they are since 
        I think the tools we have are amazing but it's the people and how they use it.
    </p>

      <h1>Lead Developer</h1>

    <h2>Lead Developer Overview</h2>
    <p>
        When it came ot leading the people in my team that it came down to giving them the barebones but
        for them to fill in the rest of the information.
    </p>

    <h2>Communicatiom</h2>
    <p>
        I really didn't communicate with them and I honestly know I could have been better at that.
        Luckily there wasn't any issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Client</h2>
    <p>
        I would say there wasn't any notifying them but more of hoping they saw the changes on github. 
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        It wasn't bad because I didn't really have to manage since their was lot of hoping that the junior
        dev did their job.
    </p>

    <h1>Junior Developer</h1>

    <h2>Junior Developer Overview</h2>
    <p>
        again, I didn't have any communication becuase I had to do some work while leaving other to do their part.
    </p>

    <h2>Expectation</h2>
    <p>
        Kind of, I had to do some research and use some AI to get an idea of what was going on.
    </p>

    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p>
        I would say I was able to contribute some parts but not all of it.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        No issues, I think it was really just to help the people out rather than taking over.

    <h1>General Question</h1>

    <h2>General Question Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The most challenging was really just managing people's project but also the amount of introverts
        there was in the class which lead to people being on there own.
    </p>

    <h2>Enjoyment</h2>
    <p>
        This project really opened up my eyes about the people and the different projects you do in the
        real world but how overcoming it was really just to stay in your lane.
    </p>

    <h2>Differently</h2>
    <p>
        I think when it comes to doing this project again that it comes to peoples attendance but even
        weighing their grade a bit if they don't show up. 
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        I would say I feel more confident in how I would approach different for the project I'm going to be
        doing since some people are eithr amazing or just a bum in how you have to carry them.
