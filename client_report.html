    <h1>Client Report</h1>

    <h2>Client Overview</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to images and content that it boiled down to finding something that describe about me and ensuring the reflection was the same
        as well, to not go away from the main project itself.
    </p>

    <h2>Communicatiom</h2>
    <p>
        I would say the main communication came down to talking to them in-person but also emailing them if there was any issues from it. The only difficult thing
        was mostly hoping that the people were there and they did wonder.
    </p>

    <h2>Devs</h2>
    <p>
        I would say they did and to the point of I think there was a bit hesistant in one of them who was afraid of trying something out of his comfort zone which is 
        understandable but as well a lack of confidence in him.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        When it comes to hiring a bunch of devs, it comes to finding the right ones who aren't afraid of trying something new but even challenging where they are since 
        I think the tools we have are amazing but it's the people and how they use it.
