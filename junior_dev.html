    <h1>Junior Developer</h1>

    <h2>Junior Developer Overview</h2>
    <p>
        again, I didn't have any communication becuase I had to do some work while leaving other to do their part.
    </p>

    <h2>Expectation</h2>
    <p>
        Kind of, I had to do some research and use some AI to get an idea of what was going on.
    </p>

    <h2>Contribution</h2>
    <p>
        I would say I was able to contribute some parts but not all of it.
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        No issues, I think it was really just to help the people out rather than taking over.
