    <h1>Lead Developer</h1>

    <h2>Lead Developer Overview</h2>
    <p>
        When it came ot leading the people in my team that it came down to giving them the barebones but
        for them to fill in the rest of the information.
    </p>

    <h2>Communicatiom</h2>
    <p>
        I really didn't communicate with them and I honestly know I could have been better at that.
        Luckily there wasn't any issues.
    </p>

    <h2>Client</h2>
    <p>
        I would say there wasn't any notifying them but more of hoping they saw the changes on github. 
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        It wasn't bad because I didn't really have to manage since their was lot of hoping that the junior
        dev did their job.
