    <h1>General Question</h1>

    <h2>General Question Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The most challenging was really just managing people's project but also the amount of introverts
        there was in the class which lead to people being on there own.
    </p>

    <h2>Enjoyment</h2>
    <p>
        This project really opened up my eyes about the people and the different projects you do in the
        real world but how overcoming it was really just to stay in your lane.
    </p>

    <h2>Differently</h2>
    <p>
        I think when it comes to doing this project again that it comes to peoples attendance but even
        weighing their grade a bit if they don't show up. 
    </p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        I would say I feel more confident in how I would approach different for the project I'm going to be
        doing since some people are eithr amazing or just a bum in how you have to carry them.
